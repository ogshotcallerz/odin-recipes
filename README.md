# odin-recipes
This is for my Odin Project called Project Recipes! 

This is the final project for the html section of fundimentals in the odin project. 
I will be creating a recipes website with the info that I have learned.



I was able to learn how to use Git and GitHub. I have learned the basic commands to use the terminal on my mac.
I learned how to create a repository, how to download it via terminal, how to google for commands that I forgot, and I need help learning how to spell lol.
I still need some practice but I know when I have messed up. I need to referance the Odin Project for my list of commands but I'm sure that I will learn it better as I spend more time with it.
