        How To Make Meatballs: The Easiest, Simplest Method

    <p>
        When I get a craving for meatballs, I have a very specific meatball in mind: They’re completely tender all the way 
        through without even a hint of toughness. They’re big enough to require a fork, but modest enough to justify several
         on the plate. Maybe some onions and fresh herbs mixed in. Nothing fancy. Totally old-school.

     <p>
        I don’t want to make anything too complicated here — meatballs are comfort food and should therefore be kept simple — 
        but let me just touch on some basics.
